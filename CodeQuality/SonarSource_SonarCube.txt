Buzzwords:
-----------
 - Continuous Inspection: 
	Continuous Inspection is a holistic, fully-realized process designed to make internal code quality an integral part of the software development life cycle. By raising its visibility for all stakeholders throughout the life cycle, Continuous Inspection enables enterprises to embrace code quality whole-heartedly.

External versus INternal Software Quality:
------------------------------------------
External, or functional, quality describes how well the software matches its 
defined functional requirements – does it perform as intended? Internal quality describes key internal 
attributes of the code, such as robustness, standards-compliance, and maintainability

Why is maintaining Code Quality Important:
------------------------------------------
ustry statistics 
show that on average, 80% of the lifetime cost of a software product is spent on maintenance, and that 
maintenance costs have a high variability depending on internal quality. This means that the level of 
maintainability a software product has today will determine the level of its cost liability tomorrow.
