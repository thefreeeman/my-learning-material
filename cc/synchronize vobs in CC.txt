ClearCase Support: How to Synchronize 2 VOBs
============================================

First, the ClearCase administrator at the site that has the needed data must create and export a synchronization packet to the site that needs that data. Here is an example of the command that does this action. Keep in mind that this command must be run on the VOB server that hosts the VOB, as the VOB owner, and the destination VOB replica must be known. 

/usr/atria/bin/multitool syncreplica –export –nc –fship replica:VOB_REPLICA@vob:VOB_TAG

This command will create a synchronization packet file in the outgoing shipping bay; by default, this directory is located here: 
/usr/atria/shipping/ms_ship/outgoing/. 

Then this synchronization packet will be shipped to the remote replica's VOB server, and then the packet file will be deleted. 

On the receiving replica, a ClearCase administrator must import the synchronization packet file that was just received. The synchronization packet will be located on the VOB replica's host server in the incoming shipping bay; by default, this directory is located here: 
/usr/atria/shipping/ms_ship/incoming/. 

So, the importing command must be run as the VOB owner and on the VOB host server. Here is the command to import a single file: 
/usr/atria/bin/multitool syncreplica – import SYNC_PACKET_FILE

Alternatively, you can import all the available synchronization packets for a single VOB with this command: 
/usr/atria/bin/multitool syncreplica – import –vob VOB_TAG -receive

Or, you can import all the synchronization packets for every VOB with this command: 
/usr/atria/bin/multitool syncreplica – import -receive


That's it! You have just synchronized one VOB replica with other VOB replica. 



so the commands are:
multitool syncreplica -export -nc -fship replica:VOB-REPLICA@vob:VOB_TAG
multitool syncreplica -import -receive
multitool syncreplica -import -vob VOB_TAG -receive
multitool syncreplica -import SYNC_PACKET 


Directory Locations:
Multitool directory: /ur/atria/bin/multitool
Incoming Shipping Bay: /usr/atria/shipping/ms_ship/incoming
Outgoing Shipping Bay: /sur/atria/shipping/ms_ship/outgoing
