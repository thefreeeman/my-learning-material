1) Check if a file assigned to the variable myfile exists and is a regular file:

#!/bin/ksh		-->shebang denotes the starting of a shellscript and on korn shell
myfile=$1		-->assigns the (file) name passed as argument, while calling the script, to the variable myfile
if [ -f $myfile ]	--> checks if the file with name $myfile exists or not
then			
echo "$myfile exists"	--> echoes the filename exists
fi			-->fi ends the if statement
exit 0			--> not known what exit 0 means, perhaps exit zeroes checks for successful processign without any errors



2) The following test command expression would be used to verify the existence of a specified directory, which is stored in the variable $mydir:


if [ -d $mydir ] 
then
command(s)
fi
