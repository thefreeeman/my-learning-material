unix is case sensitive
shells are located in the /usr/bin or /bin directory based on the flavour (type $(uname) to know which unix flavour you are using. command usage same as hostname or echo $(hosrname). 


Interpreted and not compiled
-----------------------------
shell scripts and functions are interpreted and not compiled. Both shell commands and functions are ASCII text that are read by shell command interpreter. So when we execute a shell script, or function, a command interpreter goes through the ASCII text line-by-line, loop-by-loop, test-by-test, and executes each statement as each line is reached from the top to the bottom. 

COmpiler versus Interpreter

I highly recommend akapelko's link above. The comparison w/ translating between a French and English speaker is the simplest explanation of the difference I have found: Interpreters are present (during the conversation/execution) to translate line-by-line as you speak... it's more convenient and flexible and quicker to begin, but takes more time for a given piece of content. Compilation, meanwhile, is like translating a written document that the other person can read in their own free time. It's much less flexible, but they can read it at their native language speed



What We can execute in a shell script
-------------------------------------
most any command in a shell script that we can execute from the command line. (One
exception is trying to set an execution suid or sgid, sticky bit, within a shell script; it is
not supported for security reasons.)


to remove the special function of a special character it must be immediately preceded with a
backslash, \, or enclosed within ’ ’forward tic marks (single quotes).

shells are usually available in the /usr/bin or /bin directory:
egs for Bourne Again, Korn and Bourne Shells 

/usr/bin/Bash
/usr/bin/ksh
/usr/bin/sh

or

/bin/Bash
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh

command and shortcuts :
------------------------
$uname or echo $(uname) --> unix flavour
in a shell script, you can use set -x for debugging and set -n for syntax check but needs to be commented before execution


???
vi editor:
how to go to the first line of a vi editor
how to go directlyy to the first and last character of a file
how to directly go to a specific line in a file. 

do we really need to have .sh extension for the shelll scripts

how to create a user in unix, login with multiple users and then execute the last command
