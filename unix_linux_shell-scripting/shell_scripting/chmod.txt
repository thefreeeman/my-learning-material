chmod command
=============

chmod [ugoa...][+-=][perms]...
 where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set  ugo.
       Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.

 where  The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

 rwxXst:
 select file mode bits for the affected users: 
 read (r), 
 write (w), 
 execute (or search for directories) (x), 
 execute/search only if the file  is  a directory  or already has execute permission for some user (X), 
 set user or group ID on execution (s), 
 restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  
 
 Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions  granted  to  other users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).
 
u=user who owns it
g=other users in the file's group
o=other users not in the file's group
a=all other users
If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that  are  set  in  the  umask are not affected.


chmod u=x some.txt
chmod u+s some.txt (whoever access the file is treated like the owner of the file)
chmod u-s some.txt
chmod 755 some.txt --> gives  -rwxr-xr-x permissions to the file
chmod 666 some.txt --> gives  -rw-rw-rw- permissions to the file

NOTE: 
       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the  permissions  of  symbolic  links  are  never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

Numeric permissions:
--------------------
4=read
2=wite
1=execute

so 471 means -r--rwx--x for owner,group and others respectively
so 555 means -r-xr-xr-x for owner, group and others respectively
so 700 means -rwx------ for owner, group and others respectively

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ chmod -c a=x hometapasfile.txt
mode of `hometapasfile.txt' changed from 0644 (rw-r--r--) to 0111 (--x--x--x)

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ chmod -v a=rx hometapasfile.txt
mode of `hometapasfile.txt' changed from 0111 (--x--x--x) to 0555 (r-xr-xr-x)

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ chmod -vpreserve-root a=rwx hometapasfile.txt
chmod: unknown option -- p
Try `chmod --help' for more information.

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ chmod -v -preserve-root a=rwx hometapasfile.txt
chmod: unknown option -- p
Try `chmod --help' for more information.

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ chmod -v --preserve-root a=rwx hometapasfile.txt
mode of `hometapasfile.txt' changed from 0555 (r-xr-xr-x) to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat `/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on `/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form `[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+'.




$ls -l file.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hope 123 Feb 23 24:15 file.txt

means access as :
----------------
owner=rw
group=rw
others=read only
links=1
file owner=hope
file size=123
modified date 23 feb 24:15
file name=file.txt


options:
-c :like verbose, but shows only the changes
-f, --silent, --quiet: suppresses error messages
-v: verbose, outputs diagnostics output for the file processing
--no-preserve-root: do not treat '/' in any special way (default)
--preserve-root do not operate recursively on '/'
--reference=RFILE: use RFILE's mode instead of mode values
-R, --recursive: changes files and directories recursively
--version output version information and exit
