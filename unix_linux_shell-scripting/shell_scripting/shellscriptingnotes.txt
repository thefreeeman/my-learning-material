shell script
===========
What is a UNIX shell?
---------------------
[source link: http://www.livefirelabs.com/unix_tip_trick_shell_script/unix_shell_scripting/20-unix-shell-scripting-interview-questions-and-answers-part-1.htm]

The UNIX shell is a program that serves as the interface between the user and the UNIX operating system. It is not part of the kernel, but communicates directly with the kernel. The shell translates the commands you type in to a format which the computer can understand. It is essentially a command line interpreter.

Details: 
--------
System Hardware (at the core)==>
	The Kernel (surrounding the entire system hardware)==>
		The Shell (wraps the entire Kernal) ==>
			User (who enters the commands to interact with the system



The UNIX Operating System Environment

List of commonly used UNIX shells:

 The Bourne Shell (sh)
 The C Shell (csh or tsch)
 The Bourne Again Shell (bash)
 The Korn Shell (ksh)


Some points on the shell scripts:
------------------------------------
- starts with a shebang or sharp bang as in #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/ksh
- two things specify that a script is a shell script:
	1) starting with a shebang
	2) the file is executable for which chmod command is used like:
		chmod o+x shellfile

 - $0, $1, $2 can be used to access the command line arguments int the shell script
	$0: name of the script itself
	$1: first argument
	$2: second argument and so on...


More on arguments-
------------------
 - $# shows the count of the arguments passed to the script.
 - $@ treats each quoted arguments as separate arguments but 
 - $* will consider the entire set of positional parameters as a single string.



Hard link vs. Soft link in Linux or UNIX
-----------------------------------------
Soft links are link to the file name and can reside on different filesytem as well; however hard links are link to the inode of the file and has to be on the same filesytem as that of the file. Deleting the orginal file makes the soft link inactive (broken link) but does not affect the hard link (Hard link will still access a copy of the file)

 - Hard links cannot link directories.
 - Cannot cross file system boundaries.

Symbolic links refer to:
	A symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another file.

Hard links refer to:
	The specific location of physical data.

$ ln /root/file1 /root/file2 --> creates a link
$ ln -s /path/to/file1.txt /path/to/file2.txt --> creates a symbolic link



The Bourne Shell Family
=======================

 - Bourne shell (old sh): The shell that started it all. The Bourne shell was the standard system shell in early AT&T UNIX, and most modern shells are moderately compatible with it. While this is the baseline, early Bourne shells lacked some features now universally provided. For most users, this shell is of marginal relevance, as nearly all major systems now provide a POSIX shell; only a few do not provide a POSIX shell as /bin/sh. 

 - POSIX shell (sh): This is the baseline shell. Users familiar with older UNIX systems will note that many of the features described for the POSIX shell are innovations (many of them inherited or acquired from variant shells). While an occasional reference is made to some of the limitations of earlier shells, the modern landscape is consistent in providing reasonably stable and full-featured POSIX shells. Furthermore, even on systems lacking such a shell, it is usually practical to acquire one of the other variants.

  - Almquist shell (ash) / Busybox: The Almquist shell was developed as a reasonably compatible independent reimplementation of the POSIX shell included with SVR4 UNIX. It was distributed originally primarily with BSD variants. This shell is much smaller than some of the other variants, but maintains (in its original form) POSIX compatibility. The Almquist shell is familiar to many users as the Busybox shell.

 - Bourne-again shell (bash): The GNU Bourne-again shell is the largest, and arguably most complete, shell. It has a history of aggressive feature adoption, and can run nearly anything, although early versions had some compatibility quirks. Many Linux systems ship with bash as the default /bin/sh, as does current Mac OS X. Scripts developed for bash, and using its extensions, may not run on other shells. Many users dislike the performance costs of bash. A number of scripts for Linux systems (such as the quilt patch manager) assume that the shell is bash, which has caused portability problems. Don't do that.

 - Debian Almquist shell (dash): This is a derivative of the Almquist shell used in Debian and derived systems, such as Ubuntu. It has been installed as the default shell on some Debian variants for a while now, exposing a number of scripts that erroneously depended on bash-only extensions. This shell exists as a small, fast implementation of the basic portable shell.
 - Korn shell (ksh): Developed by David G. Korn at AT&T, ksh was one of the first Bourne shell derivatives to add many of the features now adopted elsewhere as standard. There are multiple versions: historic ksh, the 1988 revision (ksh88), and the 1993 revision (ksh93). The current versions are available as source from AT&T.

 - Public-domain Korn shell (pdksh): Before the Korn shell became free software, a public domain clone of it was written. While there are a few noticeable compatibility differences, for the most part, pdksh and ksh88 are compatible implementations. A number of systems have used pdksh as a shortcut to getting a reasonably full-featured POSIX shell. More modern systems often replace pdksh with ksh93.

 - Z shell (zsh): The Z shell is probably by far the most divergent of those listed here from the historical Bourne shell. However, zsh can be configured to perform as a fairly solid POSIX shell, and on some systems it may be the only shell available that can be made to execute POSIX shell code at all.




chmod command
=============

chmod [ugoa...][+=][perms]...



chmod u=x some.txt
chmod u+s some.txt (whoever access the file is treated like the owner of the file)
chmod u-s some.txt
chmod 755 some.txt --> gives  -rwxr-xr-x permissions to the file
chmod 666 some.txt --> gives  -rw-rw-rw- permissions to the file



Numeric permissions:
--------------------
4=read
2=wite
1=execute

so 471 means -r--rwx--x for owner,group and others respectively
so 555 means -r-xr-xr-x for owner, group and others respectively
so 700 means -rwx------ for owner, group and others respectively



$ls -l file.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hope 123 Feb 23 24:15 file.txt

means access as :
----------------
owner=rw
group=rw
others=read only
links=1
file owner=hope
file size=123
modified date 23 feb 24:15
file name=file.txt


options:
-c :like verbose, but shows only the changes
-f, --silent, --quiet: suppresses error messages
-v: verbose, outputs diagnostics output for the file processing
--no-preserve-root: do not treat '/' in any special way (default)
--preserve-root do not operate recursively on '/'
--reference=RFILE: use RFILE's mode instead of mode values
-R, --recursive: changes files and directories recursively
--version output version information and exit

Unix operating system commands quick reference:
===============================================
command: env (and not $env)
============================
purpose: displays shell environment variables
usage: as follows: (executed on cygwin)

$ env
HOMEPATH=\Users\tapas
MANPATH=/usr/local/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man:
APPDATA=C:\Users\tapas\AppData\Roaming
ProgramW6432=C:\Program Files
HOSTNAME=tapas-PC
SHELL=/bin/bash
TERM=xterm
PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER=Intel64 Family 6 Model 37 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel
.
.
.

commands: 
	echo $SHELL
	echo $0
	ps -ef | grep $SHELL
============================
purpose: displays shell information. 
comments: The Shell info can also be obtained from the env command that is mentioned above. 

usage: as follows: (executed on cygwin)

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash


tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ echo $0
-bash

tapas@tapas-PC ~
$ ps -ef | grep $SHELL
   tapas    9664    1368 pty0     12:01:18 /usr/bin/bash
   tapas   11340    9664 pty0     12:36:02 /usr/bin/bash


command: awk
purpose: Finds lines in files that match a pattern and performs specified actions on those lines.
links: 
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.cmds/doc/aixcmds1/awk.htm
http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html#uh-0


usage: 
---	$ awk 'length > 20' pattern
	echo "Matching against '$pattern':"
	  $pattern) echo "$string: Match." ;;
	  *) echo "$string: No match." ;;

	The above command displays the linies that have length more than 20 in the file named 'pattern'




---	To display all lines between the words start and stop, including "start" and "stop", enter:
	 awk  '/start/,/stop/'  chapter1
	To run an awk command program, sum2.awk, that processes the file, chapter1, enter:
	 awk  -f  sum2.awk  chapter1




---	To print the first two fields in opposite order, enter:
	 awk '{ print $2, $1 }' chapter1



---	The following AWK command usage to extract the sixth field from a line of text containing colon (:) delimited fields that is stored in a variable called passwd_line?
	echo $passwd_line | awk -F: '{ print $6 }'

	Details: 
	Consider this line of text stored in the variable $passwd_line -

	$ echo $passwd_line
	mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:
	$


command: 
	set -x (to enable debugging, don't get confused with the minus sign here, it does mean enable debugging)
	set +x (to diasable debuugging, don't get confused with the plus sign here, it does mean disabling debugging) 
=====================================================================================================================
purposes: Puts the shell in trace mode. 

comments: shows each line of execution preceded by a plus sign (+).To enable debugging in the shell scripts



#!/bin/ksh
#the above is shebang or sharpbang #!
#set -x
#debugging has been commented above

i=1
while [ $i -lt 6 ]
do
print "in loop iteration: $i"
((i+=1))
done
exit


command: grep
============================
usage: as mentioned below:

---  	cat myfile.txt | grep name
		or
	grep name myfile.txt
	grep name myfile*.txt
	grep -i name myfile*.txt

	finds for the line contining the string 'name' in the file 'myfile.txt'

---	to find regular expressions in the files
	grep REGEX <filename>
	
	$grep "lines*empty" myfile.txt
	This is an exampleofa file line that contains empty. 
	$

---	grep -iw "searchforthisword" myfile.txt
	searches for the word - "searchforthisword" in a case-insensitive manner int he file myfile.txt


---	grep -A 2 "searchstring" myfile.txt
	grep -B 2 "searchstring" myfile.txt
	grep -C 2 "searchstring" myfile.txt

	The above commands finds for the string 'searchstring' and greps the 2 lines after (A), before (B) and both before and after (C) of match


---	grep -r "searchstring" *
	searches recursively for "searchstring"

---	grep -v -e <pattern> -e <pattern>
	grep -v -e "a" -e "b" -e "c" myfile.txt
	Displays the lines that does NOT contain (-v option) the  <pattern> (-e option)



--- 	grep -c searchstring myfile.txt
	grep -v -c searchstring myfile.txt
	counts the lines that does match and doesnot match (-v option) the pattern searchstring

--- 	grep -l searchstring myfile.txt
	displays only the filenames that matches the pattern searchstring


--- 	$grep -o "is.*line" myfile.txt
	is line is the 1st lower case line 
	is line
	is is the last lin
	$
	so the above only displays the matched string for the pattern provided. The entire line containing the pattern is not displayed, only the matched pattern is displayed. 

---	-n: shows the line number while displaying the output
	-b: shows the position of the match in the line. 




command: cut
==============
[source link]: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/06/cut-command-examples/
usage:

$ cat test.txt
cat command for file oriented operations.
cp command for copy files or directories.
ls command to list out files and directories with its attributes.

$ cut -c2 test.txt
a
p
s

$ cut -c1-3 test.txt
cat
cp
ls

$ cut -c3- test.txt
t command for file oriented operations.
 command for copy files or directories.
 command to list out files and directories with its attributes.

$ cut -c-8 test.txt
cat comm
cp comma
ls comma

$ cut -c- test.txt
cat command for file oriented operations.
cp command for copy files or directories.
ls command to list out files and directories with its attributes.

$ cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
bala


$grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd  --> for this example understanding, the output of the grep command without pipelinign the output to the cut command
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bala:x:1000:1000:bala,,,:/home/bala:/bin/bash


$ grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd | cut -d':' -f1,6 --> displays fields 1 and 6 that are separated by delimiter :
root:/root
bala:/home/bala

$ grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd | cut -d':' -f1-4,6,7 --> displays fields 1 through 4, and 6 and 7 that are separated by delimiter :
root:x:0:0:/root:/bin/bash
bala:x:1000:1000:/home/bala:/bin/bash

$ grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd | cut -d'|'  -f1  --> displays the entire lines even if the delimiter does not exists
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bala:x:1000:1000:bala,,,:/home/bala:/bin/bash


$ grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd | cut -d'|' -s -f1  --> displays lines that only contains the delimiter; no output here as there is no line that contains | as delimiter


command: sed
=============
comments: stands for stream editor
[source link, yes it ends in a 0]: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-0
usage:


the substitute option in sed:

sed s/day/night/ <old >new  --> substitutes day with night fromt the file old to new
sed s/day/night/ old >new   -->same as above
echo day | sed s/day/night/ --> echoes night
echo Sunday | sed 's/day/night/' --> echoes Sunnight and not Sunday
sed 's/one/ONE/' <file		--> replaces one with ONE on each line in the file 

Substiture command in detail:
------------------------------
...sed s/one/two  ....

The character after the s is the delimiter. It is conventionally a slash, because this is what ed, more, and vi use. It can be anything you want, however. If you want to change a pathname that contains a slash - say /usr/local/bin to /common/bin - you could use the backslash to quote the slash:

sed 's/\/usr\/local\/bin/\/common\/bin/' <old >new
Gulp. Some call this a 'Picket Fence' and it's ugly. It is easier to read if you use an underline instead of a slash as a delimiter:

sed 's_/usr/local/bin_/common/bin_' <old >new
Some people use colons:

sed 's:/usr/local/bin:/common/bin:' <old >new
Others use the "|" character.

sed 's|/usr/local/bin|/common/bin|' <old >new
Pick one you like. As long as it's not in the string you are looking for, anything goes. And remember that you need three delimiters. If you get a "Unterminated `s' command" it's because you are missing one of them.
