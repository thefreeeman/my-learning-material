---> some useful information on commands:
	ls / 			--> lists contents of the root directory
	ls . 			--> lists contents of the current directory
	ls | more 		--> for listing the contents of a directory one screen at a time. 
	ls | sort 		--> for listing the files in the sorted manner. 
	ls | spell | sort 	--> for listing the files by first spell checking and then displaying in sorted manner;does not work on cygwin and on bash perhaps. 
	ls | wc -l >> directoryinfo 	--> for appending the count of the items in the directory to the directoryinfo file. 
	ls | grep patterninfo	--> lists the contents of the directory that matches the patteninfo.
	ls patterninfo		--> lists the contents of the directory named / matching pattern name patterninfo (patterninfo is contained in the current directory)
	ls -lR			--> displays the directory contents recursively
	ls -lR directoryinfo	--> displays recursively the contents of the directoryinfo (note that's an R and not an r)
	ls -a			--> displays hidden files too. hidden files are the ones that start with a . in their name

	more filenametoread	--> displays the contents of the file filenametoread. 
	less filenametoread	--> same as more but with more options; yet to be explored





	cd ~ 			--> takes you to the home directory (and not the root directory). ~ usually is /home/users/y/yourid/ or something like this. 

passwd:
	passwd 			--> command to change the password for the current user
	yppasswd 		--> command tochange current user password in some unix-like environments
	
man:
	man commandtoman	--> displays manual pages for the commandtoman
	man -k commandtoman	--> displays manual pages for the commandtoman, but int the CodeListing format; quite useful command
	apropos commandtoman	--> same as man -k command; more info can be found by "man -k apropos", quite simple,huh!
	man 1 commandtoman or man -s 1 commandtoman	--> displays the section 1 of the manual pages forthe command commandtoman
	man last commandtoman	--> displays the last section of the manualpages for the commandtoman
	man passwd | col -b -x > ~/my.password.command.notes --> to make a copy of the passwd man page, sans formatting, in your home 	directory, under the name my.password.command.notes
	The col -b -x command fixes some formatting oddities; without it, all of the underlined words might show up as _u_n_d_e_r_l_i_n_e, depending on the system.)
	/<string-to-search>	--> finds an option or keyword in the man pages; hit 'n' to search the next occurence
	

mkdir:
	mkdir -p ~/learning/Unix-N-Shell-scripting/Unix-Commands	-->	creates the specified directorties recursively


	
cp / mv  / rm / diff:
	cp -r sourcedir destdir	--> copies 'recursively' source dir to destination dir
	cp -i srcfile destfile	--> copies src file to dest file,but insists  that the system prompts u before you copy an existing file
	mv -i srcfileordir destfileordir
	rm -i -- bad-file-name	--> to remove files with bad names that start with a --
	find ~ -name '*.backup' -ok rm {} \; --> to find and remove files with confirmation
	find ~ -name
