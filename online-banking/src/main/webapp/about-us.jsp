										<div align="justify">
											Presto Bank derives its name and inspiration from the Indus
											Valley civilisation -a culture described by National
											Geographic as 'one of the greatest of the ancient world'
											combining a spirit of innovation with sound business and
											trade practices.<br> <br> Mr. Srichand P. Hinduja,
											a leading Non-Resident Indian businessman and head of the
											Hinduja Group, conceived the vision of Presto Bank -the
											first of the new-generation private banks in India -and
											through collective contributions from the NRI community
											towards India's economic and social development, brought our
											Bank into being.<br> <br> The Bank, formally
											inaugurated in April 1994 by Dr. Manmohan Singh, Honourable
											Prime Minister of India who was then the country’s Finance
											Minister, started with a capital base of Rs.1,000 million
											(USD 32 million at the prevailing exchange rate), of which
											Rs.600 million was raised through private placement from
											Indian Residents while the balance Rs.400 million (USD 13
											million) was contributed by Non-Resident Indians.<br>
